# > Cryptographic Challenge

## > Your Mission

Greetings, Agent.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to **decipher the secret message** hidden within this transmission. A once-readable word has been cleverly transformed into a mysterious sequence of numbers and symbols using a powerful cryptographic method.

---

### > The Ciphertext

Here is your encrypted message:

```
( x,,[Del]š¹àD )
```

---

### ? Hints

- The **shift value** used in the cipher is between **0 and 20**.
- The encryption is **geometric** in nature.
- Pay close attention to the patterns and transformations.

**Good luck !**
