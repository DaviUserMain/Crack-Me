# ðŸ”³ Cryptographic Challenge: Level 1 ðŸ”³

## Your Mission

Greetings, Agent.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to decipher the secret message contained in this transmission. What was once a readable word has been transformed into a sequence of numbers using a powerful public-key cryptography system.

This message will self-destruct upon reading (not really, but it sounds cooler). Good luck.

### ðŸ“œ The Ciphertext

The sequence of numbers you need to decipher is: ( xÃ¤[Del]Å¡Â¹Ã D )

Obs: shift is between 0 to 20 and the encryption is geometric, good luck :)
